      <p>This is my cat Covie and she is 2 years old, her bread is Scottish mixed with British which is kind of rare bread in Saudi Arabia. we adopted her when she was 3 months old during the beginning of Covid-19. fun fact we named her Covie because we adopted her during Covid-19 and she was the reason of my happiness during quarantine. I got attached to her during my presence in Saudi Arabia. Although we are thousand miles apart she still means a lot to me and I still try to talk to her every day.</p>
